      and your clearance level has been upgraded from D-class to C-class. While sleeping
      you have been exposed to SCP-[REDACTED] and therefore granted its anomalous
      abilities, making you the ideal subject for this project.

      your own consciousness to a suitable entity marked with [REDACTED] upon death,
      as well as [REDACTED]. This project will consist of you, Dr. [REDACTED], to
      be exposed to several SCPs. During such exposure, you will need to identify,
      categorize, and possibly survive these encounters. You will not be given any
      information regarding these SCP''s prior to exposure but instead, you will
      have access to one D-class personnel who, with a list of SCPs that you might
      encounter, will be able to help you through the process.'

    _text: "<color=white>Control </color> When you complete an encounter, the Foundation
      will score you depending on four factors: Correctly identifying the SCP in
      question, Viewing its anomalous properties, Remaining alive, and Collecting
      useful data through the interaction with it. The last one is somewhat of a
      bonus and a bit vague, as some SCPs might not be able or willing to release
      such information, while with others it might be necessary to use unconventional
      methods to acquire said data, the best way to gain points via the last factor
      is to be as inquisitive as possible during an encounter, keeping in mind that
      some SCPs are volatile at best and world-ending at worst. Note that you don\u2019t
      have to fulfill all of these factors, and in some cases, it might not even
      be possible but do consider that it costs the foundation a significant amount
      of money to procure [REDACTED] for your re-animation.."

      type of containment should the SCP be held in, said SCP will be moved accordingly.
      Best case scenario, the Foundation will have wasted money on unnecessary containment,
      worst case there might be a containment breach. If that happens the program
      as well as you and your D-class assistant will be terminated ASAP as deemed
      too dangerous. Unless the SCP that escaped doesn\u2019t kill you first that
      is. What are the points necessary for you may ask? Well, if you score too low
      you will be excluded from the experiment and possibly terminated. If you identify
      incorrectly the SCP twice. if you die three times or if you select the wrong
      containment procedure three times you will fail the experiment. If you want
      to prevent this, the best solution is to find bonus information. For every
      two bonus info you find, we will consider one of your failures as a success.

      various stray bullet holes in them and others still stained in blood. You get
      taken to a different accommodation. One that looks more fit for a researcher.

      made on the ceiling. You run towards it and look up for an escape. You see
      nothing and for a moment you feel frightened, thinking that maybe you arrived
      to late, but that feeling slowly fades away as the sound of a helicopter become
      louder and louder until you see it above you. The chopper throws a rope down
      which you grab almost instantly. The vehicle then gains altitude as the rope
      tightens and lifts you up, outside the building. As you rise up you see various
      smoke clouds rise from the foundation building as you fly away from it, finally
      feeling free as that sight gets lost in the distance.*'

      already morphed into a similar creature you saw in the last encounter. You
      keep running as high-pitched screeches fill echo through the corridor as a
      containment breach alarm starts sounding. After some corridor zig-zags and
      a few close calls with patrol guards, you finally arrive in what you read from
      the label on the door you passed to be the central reactor. You pass various
      closed doors with your keypad until you reach the main console. You look around

      not yet our respect. We have a task for you in that regard. If our records
      are correct, you will be encountering SCP 662. Your job will be to use him
      to escape the encounter room and retrieve an item for the insurgency. Once
      you have exited the room, turn left, then left again. On your right, there
      will be two doors, which will be unguarded through our means. Go to the second
      one and enter this code: 45772. Once the door is opened there will be a box
      with the inscription "Here were dragons". Open the box and eat the crystal
      in it. Once that is done come back to your computer and check your e-mails.

      will allow one-way communication with security personnel outside of the SCP's
      containment. You can ask for aid during the experiment at any time. To use
      it just turn on the radio and ask for one D-class personnel to interact with
      the SCP. Don't worry, your friend won't be used in this case, and remember,
      it's a one-way radio, so the security personnel won't be able to answer any
      questions you have during the experiment. One last thing, this encounter will
      be different from the previous one as the SCP you will be interacting with
      is sentient. This means that because of [REDACTED] you will only have a limited
      number of questions you may ask it. This encounter should prove more challenging
      than the previous so I hope you are ready.

      leaking from its eyes and mouth. As soon as you lay eyes on it, you notice
      how well made its curves are, truly accentuating the human form. How pleasant
      it would be to touch the marble-like material it is made of. Before you realize
      you are already halfway to the pedestal. For a second you wonder how you got
      here but swiftly ignore such doubt only to focus back on the mask. You gently
      remove the glass case and place it on the floor. "My God," you think "How good
      must it feel to wear it" you continue before quickly grasping the mask and
      bringing it closer to your face. "What mastery of craftsmanship must have been
      necessary to create such art!" you say out loud. You then proceed to flip the
      mask and bring it slowly to your face. As you do, you start feeling your eyelids
      become heavier and heavier, until your senses abandon you.

      the monitor the D-class convulsing and trying to remove the mask without any
      success. He then stops moving and leaves his hands dangling on his sides. His
      head then slowly moves towards the door, as you notice that the mask's face
      has changed, from frowning to smiling. The D-class then slowly moves his right
      hand up and starts waving at you.

    _text: <color=purple>Mask:</color> Oh I love telling this one. So I was once
      a court Jester in the Kingdom of Alagadda. I entertained royalty day after
      day with my comedic plays and dramatic events, oh how they loved the shows
      I used to put on. Well unfortunately that didn't last long. One day a mob of
      peasants stormed the castle, and I, not much into politics was caught surprised
      by those filthy ignorants and got myself beheaded, dying with my king. But
      low and behold three days later... my king and I resurrected! And before you
      ask no, we thought of it before Christianity did... Anyroad... the king wasn't
      his usual self anymore... he did still enjoy very much my plays, so much so
      that he made me court advisor, making many lords jealous of me, but I could
      tell he was being kept in chains from realizing his full potential. So I decided
      to formulate a plan to free him... alas it was all for naught as those filthy
      lords had caught up with my scheme and wanted to govern Alagadda by themselves,
      so I was thrown in the dungeons to rot. That did not stop me though as I had
      a faithful servant retrieve an obsidian key to escape the dungeons. In doing
      so I removed my face for my servant to wear.. which is the mask you see before
      you and then possessed him. After that I could not bear the weight of facing
      my king again.. so I exiled myself into the dreadful dimensional backwater
      that you call reality.

      at the time and we were in the middle of an Othello play.. when all of a sudden
      one of the actors faints on the spot. I did think for a brief moment that he
      was so stunned by my word-play that his senses abandoned him, but his shirt
      started staining red from his blood so I abandoned that thought. Someone shouted
      for a doctor and low an behold there he was, in all of his glory. He didnt
      have his mask during that period, and liked more saving people rather than
      transforming them into zombies... Oh sorry I'm side-tracking. Yeah so he rushed
      to the stage and swiftly opened his med case using all kinds of tools to stop
      the blood.. but it was the plague and even if he stopped the blood, the necrosis
      would take him in a day or two. Well I was awed by his hero-like attitude at
      the time, and since then we travelled europe together.
